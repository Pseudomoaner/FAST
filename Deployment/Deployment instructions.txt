When preparing a new release, peform the following steps:

Part 1: Assembling the files
1: Make a new release on Github. Download the associated .zip file.
2: Unzip to this folder.
3: Add the latest version of the bioformats_package.jar file to the /homePanel/bfmatlab folder
4: Zip up everything and upload to the Wiki (see part 3).

Part 2: Compiling the application
1: Either start a new .prj file with the application packager app in Matlab, or load an old one. In either case, ensure metadata fields are filled out correctly, including DeploymentSplash.png and MiniLogo.png as your splash screens and logo respectively.
2: Ensure you have added the set of files you wish to form the package to your path (i.e. the contents of this folder)
3: Select 'homePanel.m' as your main file, Matlab will then find the majority of the linked functions and add them automatically.
4: Files you will need to add manually to the 'Files required for your application to run' field:
	-bioformats_package.jar
	-TextLogoLarge.png
	-Divisions.png
	-Featues.png
	-Overlays.png
	-Plotting.png
	-Segmentation.png
	-Tracking.png
5: Once files are all together, click the 'Package' checkmark
6: If you want to debug compiled code, make sure to uncheck the 'Do not display the Windows Command Shell (console) for execution' box, under Additional runtime settings. This will be on by default.

Part 3: Uploading the application
1: Once files are compiled, upload the installer (in the for_redistribution folder) to the website via cPanel.
2: Also upload the uncompiled files as a .zip (made in part 1).
3: Update links on the home page, the installation page, and the installer page.

PLATFORM SPECIFIC ISSUES
Mac: The Macbook Pro I'm using is so old it doesn't support any version of the Matlab compiler newer than 2017a. You'll need to run the entire compilation using this version (or earlier).
Ubuntu: To open Matlab from Terminal, type ./bin/matlab, after navigating to the matlab directory in /home/oli/Apps/.
To run FAST once it has been installed from the command line, type /Path/To/FAST/application/run_FAST.sh /Path/To/MR/v95/, where /Path/To/FAST indicates the location where FAST was installed and /Path/To/MR indicates the location where the Matlab runtime was installed.
