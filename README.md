## The Feature-Assisted Segmenter/Tracker

Have you struggled with automated measurement of the movement of many closely-packed individuals? The Durham lab's tracking system, FAST, may be the answer to your problems.

### Features

* A user-friendly GUI, designed to minimise the number of parameters that must be chosen and maximise immediate user feedback for those that do.
* Flexible design, accommodating a range of different workflows and dataset types.
* Rapid algorithms with low memory requirements, allowing thousands of objects to be tracked simultaneously on a standard laptop computer.
* Integrated overlay and plotting systems, allowing rapid validation and visualisation of tracking data.
* No need for a Matlab license - FAST is also available as a free stand-alone application.

**Please note that FAST depends on Bio-Formats for full functionality.** To use FAST from the code available here, please download the latest version of [Bio-Formats for Matlab](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/) and add the bioformats_package.jar file to your homePanel/bfmatlab folder. Alternatively, you can download a pre-packaged version of FAST from [the wiki](https://mackdurham.group.shef.ac.uk/FAST_DokuWiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=setup:installation).

A publication detailing the implementation and functionality of FAST is currently under preparation. In the mean time, if you find this software useful, please cite it using the DOI [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/237035985.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/237035985)
