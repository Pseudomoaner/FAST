## The Feature-Assisted Segmenter/Tracker

Have you struggled with automated measurement of the movement of many closely-packed individuals? The Durham lab's tracking system, FAST, may be the answer to your problems.

### Features

* A user-friendly GUI, designed to minimise the number of parameters that must be chosen and maximise immediate user feedback for those that do.
* Flexible design, accommodating a range of different workflows and dataset types.
* Rapid algorithms with low memory requirements, allowing thousands of objects to be tracked simultaneously on a standard laptop computer.
* Integrated overlay and plotting systems, allowing rapid validation and visualisation of tracking data.
* No need for a Matlab license - FAST is also available as a free stand-alone application.
